# ar10-tracker
A web app to collect, store and visualise 10m Air Rifle Training and Competition Data.

## Proposal
10m Air Rifle athletes on the Troops2Target (T2T) programme are collecting training and competition data to monitor and track performance improvement. This data is required to support performance planning and report on progress to T2T management to maintain their place on the T2T programme.
Currently, each athlete is utilising a separate system which results in a disjointed approach to collecting and sharing data.

Athletes need to record:
+ competition performance (competition type, score, rank)
+ training competition performance (score)
+ training (SCATT) data.

## Solution
Create a web application to collect, store and report competition and training data.
+ Django
